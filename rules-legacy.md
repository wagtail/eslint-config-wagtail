## Rules

For each item in this table, do:

- Check the documentation page from the package that defines the rule (there's a link)
- If it's enabled by default via `recommended` rules that we're already using, mark "Copied" as ❌ and add a note about it being enabled by default
- If it's not enabled by default, review if it makes sense for us to adopt it (based on usefulness and relevance with modern practices)
- If it makes sense, copy the rule to index.js and mark "Copied" as ✅. Try to retain the "Config" value, but if any config value already matches the default for that rule, then leave it be
- If the "Config" says "see Config", don't bother following the link for the config and just enable the rule, but add a note about this like "review config"
- If it doesn't make sense to enable this, mark "Copied" as ❌ and add a note on why it's not enabled
- When in doubt, lean towards enabling the rule, but write a note on further considerations
